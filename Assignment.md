## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

Write about **4 things** you expected to learn during the Git crash course (yes, we all came in with some big hopes 😅).
For each one, mention:

What you thought it would be like **(Expectation 👀)**

What you actually learned **(Reality 😅)**

And how it helped with your personal portfolio project 💻

make it honest—and if it surprised you, even better!

Example format:

**🧠 What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**
**1. Concept: Branching**

`Expectation 👀` : I thought branching was just for developers working on big apps—nothing I’d need for a small project.

`Reality 😅`: Turns out even solo devs need branches! It helped me avoid breaking my main code while testing new designs.

`Impact 💡`: I created a feature branch for my "About Me" section and merged it smoothly into the main branch after testing. Super useful!
