## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

**🧠 What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**
**1. Concept: Branching**

`Expectation 👀` : I thought branching was not complicated just a way for different people to work on the same project.

`Reality 😅`: Branching entails a lot more especially things like resolving conflicts and also branching is used in solo developing.

`Impact 💡`: I created a feature branch for my "Profile details" section and merged it smoothly into the main branch after testing. 
**2. Concept: Conflicts**

`Expectation 👀` : I was never aware about merge conflicts before.

`Reality 😅`: Merge conflicts can occur pretty often especially when working on a project with other people.

`Impact 💡`: I was able to resolve all the conflicts and managed to merge with the main branch.
**3. Concept: Projects**

`Expectation 👀` : I was never aware about projects before and what it was about.

`Impact 💡`: I was able to understand the purpose of a project and how it can be used to monitor the progress of a project and was able to create a project for my group.
**4. Concept: Milestones and Issues**

`Expectation 👀` : I was never aware about milestones and issues before and what it was about.

`Impact 💡`: I was able to understand the purposes of issues especially in committing code and the use of milestones. I was able to create multiple issues and assign them to various commits.
